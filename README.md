- 👋 Hi, I’m Sam (@mnopqr1).
- 👀 I’m interested in compilers, uses of mathematical logic in CS, graphics, and how to visualize complex ideas.
- 🌱 I have so far been working in academia, first did a PhD and post-docs in mathematics, then became a CS professor. I wrote research articles, a book, and taught math and programming to people around the world.
- ✨ This account collects my programming projects, many done at the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com). I sometimes write [blogs](https://mnopqr1.github.io) about them.
- 💞️ I’m always happy to collaborate on [any of these ideas](https://github.com/mnopqr1/ideas).
- 📫 I am currently based in Europe (GMT+1).
