- 👋 Hi, I’m Sam (@mnopqr1).
- 👀 I’m currently interested in compilers, uses of mathematical logic in CS, graphics, and how to visualize complex ideas.
- 🌱 I’ve so far had a career in academia, first as a PhD student in mathematics and now as associate professor of computer science.
- ✨ This account collects my personal programming projects, especially those at the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com). I sometimes write [blogs](https://mnopqr1.github.io) about them.
- 💞️ I’m always happy to collaborate on [any of these ideas](https://github.com/mnopqr1/ideas).
- 📫 I am currently based in Europe (GMT+1).
